Hi,

Thanks for giving the Obsidian IRC Client a whirl. Please remember that this is
relativly speaking very early on in the development process, there is much yet to
be done, we ask that you be patient with us :^)

Firstly, we require your help. We can only do so much testing, and the more time
we spend doing that internally, the less time we have to brainstorm and add new
cool stuff.

Secondly, we think you know what you're doing. Please prove us right.

What we need you to do is this- look at Obsidian from the point of view of a user,
not a programmer or anything else (though that IS useful though when you need to report
an error ;)).

If you think something's a bit odd in how it works, then tell us (this includes the ugly
icons). I guess what I'm trying to say is, you're not just an alpha tester- you're also
part of the QA process to ensure we get the best possible program by release time.

Before reporting, playing, or doing ANYTHING else, please read the below list of known
attached oddities, thanks.

Should you have any further questions, do not hesitate to contact me :).

Have fun! :)

KNOWN ISSUES:
The following is a list of known issues with Obsidian as current. This list is (probably)
not totally up to date, or complete. It will give you a rough idea of some of the things
that we don't need reported ;)

It also aims to give you a primer of some of what to expect from Obsidian in this (and the
next alpha or two)

0.	Connecting/etc is SLOW!
	Yeah, I know this one (painfully so!).
	The current sockets implementation is ugly, and totally synchronous. Meaning that the
	whole of Obsidian sits and waits while the computer tries to turn irc.chatspike.net into
	an IP. This is a bad thing, and something that needs to be fixed! :p
1.	Most commands haven't been overridden from the default behaviour.
	Long description is that I haven't written things like /query, /ctcp, /msg and all
	the rest. Stuff you enter will be used like raw protocol, so you can (theoretically)
	still send a CTCP if you know what you're doing. This should be fixed by the next alpha.
2.	Network Editor buttons don't work
	The network editor isn't really finished. In fact, it's hardly started :P. All that's there
	is an interface to load/parse the information stored in a 'networks' directory and display it
	into the form. I have yet to decide how I'm going to implement the rest of the fancy stuff.
3.	Options dialog doesn't have much in it/doesn't save/doesn't work
	Yup. Not sure what I'm going to do with it yet, and really it needs the Network Editor
	to be finished first so I can start figuring out how I'm going to be saving data.
4.	The toolbar looks really empty
	Yeah, yeah. I'm not even sure it's going to be in the finals, so don't whinge about it ;)
	That said, it'll probably stay. I just have more important things to do than add pretty buttons
	and actually make them do something yet 8)
5.	"My Buddies"...?
	Not written yet. The current plan is it's going to be kind of similar to mIRC's WATCH/X-Chat NOTIFY,
	except a bit cooler, and easier to manage. (And not going to happen on every network unless you
	specify that :P)
6.	The icons/artwork are ugly
	I know. I'm not artistic really. If you want to try and do a better job, you're welcome.
	(although- I rather like the "About" screen.. still, if I like it, I'll use it ;))
7.	AIEEE! I click 'X' and my whole server closes!?
	You probably had the server window selected as active.
	If it's a private message/channel window, it'll be more forgiving ;)
8.	Oh, last issue! Currently we don't buffer previous commands, so you'll have to type everything out
	rather than whacking up/down to cycle through previous commands.
